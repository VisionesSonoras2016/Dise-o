Founded in 2015, the Berlin based interdisciplinary label and collective; oqko, envisions both 
organic and hybrid experimentation towards the core of its perception of Ã¦sthetics.
A series of installations, performances and releases backs the output of oqko's four members, 
valuing the plurality of todays formats and expressions.
