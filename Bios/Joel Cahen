Based in London and with a background in sound design and music for stage and screen productions as well as new media, his current interests interrogate the affect of sound in various spaces (physical, cultural and the body). Since 2008, he has been performing worldwide with Wet Sounds, an underwater concert project that sonifies both wet and dry areas of the swimming pools; Scrap Club, the public Destructivist activity, where the audience smash up various stuff with sledgehammers; Cacophonic!, weekly live abstract mash ups on Resonance 104.4fm London; and productions for Interzone Theatre, audio based augmented reality theatre in public spaces of the city.
Joel co-founded the England registered charity Liquid Vibrations with Adele Drake (Founder of Drake Music) and started underwater listening sessions for children with special needs at Special Schools in the UK. His work has been presented at ISEA, AV Festival, ATP, Helsinki Festival, The Royal Neurological Hospital, and various symposia, music and art festivals worldwide.
